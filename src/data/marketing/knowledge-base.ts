 *  BITSOL Marketing — knowledge base
 * =============================================================================
 *
 *  The assistant answers MARKETING conversations from this content first and
 *  only falls back to general model knowledge when nothing matches. It is never
 *  loaded for an INSTITUTE conversation.
 *
 *  Two sources make up the base:
 *    1. Hand-written company entries below (about, process, pricing, support…)
 *    2. Auto-derived entries, one per service, built from the catalogue so a
 *       service edit updates the assistant's answers in exactly one place.
 *
 *  Seeded into `knowledge_base_marketing` and editable from Admin → Knowledge
 *  Base thereafter.

    question: "What is BITSOL Marketing and what do you do?",
    answer: `${brand.description}\n\nWe work across four areas: **Business Services**, **Digital Solutions**, **AI Automation** and **Software Development**. Practically, that means AI chatbots and agents, WhatsApp automation, digital marketing and SEO, websites, mobile apps, custom software, UI/UX, branding and corporate training. We are based in ${brand.contact.city} and work with clients across Pakistan and internationally.`,

    question: "Why should we choose BITSOL Marketing?",
    answer:
      "Three reasons clients give us:\n\n1. **We build and market.** Most agencies do one or the other. We can design your brand, build the software, and then run the campaigns that fill it — so nothing falls between vendors.\n2. **AI is our core, not an add-on.** We ship production AI systems, so automation advice comes from delivery experience rather than a sales deck.\n3. **You own everything.** Source code, design files, ad accounts and data stay yours. No lock-in.\n\nWe also report honestly — including when something isn't working.",

    answer:
      "1. **Discovery call (free)** — 30 minutes to understand your goal, current setup and constraints.\n2. **Proposal & quote** — scope, deliverables, timeline and a fixed price, usually within 2–3 working days.\n3. **Kickoff** — advance payment, project channel opened, milestones agreed.\n4. **Delivery in milestones** — you review and approve at each stage rather than at the end.\n5. **Launch & handover** — files, access, training and documentation transferred to you.\n6. **Support** — an optional monthly care or retainer plan.\n\nYou get a named point of contact throughout.",
